## About

This modpack is a magic/engineering modpack used on my Minecraft server with friends.
It's focused on creating factories and using magic, but also contains lots of food items, more bows, hammers for mining bigger areas (3x3, 5x5, etc.) and a few quality of life mods.

Other than that the modpack contains mods like [Sodium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium) to improve performance on the client-side as well as server-side.
